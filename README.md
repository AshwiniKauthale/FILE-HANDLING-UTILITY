# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS :

    This Java program demonstrates basic file operations: reading from, writing to, and modifying text files. These are fundamental tasks for many applications that require persistent storage of data. The example uses the java.io package, which provides the necessary classes for file manipulation.

 Libraries Used:
 
BufferedWriter: This class is used to write text to a file efficiently. 

FileWriter: This class is used for writing data to a file. It converts character data into bytes and writes it to a specified file.

BufferedReader: This class is used to read text from a file efficiently. It buffers the input to minimize the number of read operations.

FileReader: This class is used to read character files. It converts bytes into characters and is used in combination with BufferedReader to read the content of the file in the program.

IOException: This is an exception class used to handle errors during file operations. When reading from or writing to files, there can be issues such as missing files, file permission errors, or input/output stream problems, all of which throw an IOException.
